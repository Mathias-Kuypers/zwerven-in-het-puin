For Björk, a video is not a promotional necessity, but a graceful tool to ease the passage of her music into your brain. “It functions as a shortcut,” she’s said “Most people’s eyes are more mature than their ears. Some songs perhaps need a dozen listens to sink in. With a visual, it will sometimes take only one or two takes—as long as there is synchronicity between the two.”
